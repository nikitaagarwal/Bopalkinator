The Chrome-Parser is a Google Chrome Extension that replaces all instances on your browser with whatever you input in the content.js file (much like the Drumpfinator application featured on John Oliver).

Application is available for download on the Google Chrome Application Store, under the name "Bopalkinator" -- which is an instance of the extension I made myself as an example.
